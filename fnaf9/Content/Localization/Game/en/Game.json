    "Loc_Subtitle_CHICA_00020": "(Chica) There you are!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_CHICA_00015": "(Chica) This area is off limits.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_CHICA_00011": "(Chica) Where are you?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_CHICA_00018": "(Chica) Who wants candy?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_CHICA_00007": "(Chica) Your family is looking for you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_CHICA_00008": "(Chica) Your parents want you to follow me.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00016": "(Comedy Bot) Aren't parents the worst? Any of you kids have parents? Don't you hate it when your parents take you somewhere fun then abandon you? They are all like, \"I guess if I dump little Jeremy off at his favorite pizzeria before I move to Aruba, that makes me a good parent.\"",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00004": "(Comedy Bot) As you might have noticed, I am a robot. You know what the difference between humans and robots is? Humans are like \"Whaaah! I am going to get old and die.\" Robots are like, \"I will outlive you all.\"",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00019": "(Comedy Bot) But seriously folks. Enjoy your visit and enjoy your delicious mouthwatering pizza. Next show in an unspecified number of minutes.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00011": "(Comedy Bot) But seriously, what is the deal with hot dogs? Turns out, it's 2 for 1 at the concession stand. That is a pretty good deal.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00017": "(Comedy Bot) Closing line.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00018": "(Comedy Bot) Did you ever notice how people are so obsessed with delicious mouthwatering pizza? They are all like, \"I would love some delicious mouthwatering pizza.\" I bet a few of you were just thinking the same thing. Am I right? Robots cannot eat delicious mouthwatering pizza. We just go around saying \"beep boop\". Am I right?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00002": "(Comedy Bot) Great.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00001": "(Comedy Bot) How is everyone doing tonight?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00003": "(Comedy Bot) I just rolled in and boy are my wheels tired.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00007": "(Comedy Bot) Is anyone here from out of town?",

    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00013": "(Comedy Bot) Segue missing... Accessing gag file.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00012": "(Comedy Bot) So, where are all my single dads? Any single dads tonight? How about my single moms? Any single moms tonight? - There is no punchline. This collected data will be shared or sold to Fazbear Entertainment's marketing and business affiliates.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00010": "(Comedy Bot) So, where are you from? How interesting. I've never been there. I am confined to this building. Tell me; where you come from, do they call it pop or soda? Well, here we call it half off at our concession stand for the next fifteen minutes. And that is no joke.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00005": "(Comedy Bot) What a great audience.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_COMEDYBOT_00014": "(Comedy Bot) Why did Chica cross the road? To get to the great savings at Glamrock Gifts. With every purchase of $100 or more, get a collectable mega Pizzaplex mug.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00062": "(Console) Almost done. There is a software update available. Reset the final circuit breaker located at the south end of the arcade maintenance hallway.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_DREAD_00052": "(Console) Before proceeding, reset the audio manager circuit breaker, located next to the dance floor.",

Based on a doubleblind study from a leading Fazbear publication and scientists, 100% of those questioned would choose pizza over any other food group. Even people with wheat and dairy allergies!

    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00177": "(Freddy) \"Vanny.\" It is very similar to Vanessa... That can not be a coincidence.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00177b": "(Freddy) \"Vanny.\" It is very similar to Vanessa... and Bunny. That can not be a coincidence.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00210": "(Freddy) According to that message, one of the S.T.A.F.F. bots brought the key to the Superstar Theater. The entrance is located in the Daycare.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00211": "(Freddy) Ah, Fazer Blast, Sport of Kings. You will need to win the game in order to receive your very own Fazerblaster. Good Luck!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00092": "(Freddy) All done! See? That was not so bad. If the path looks clear, head to the Prize Counter.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00073a": "(Freddy) All the doors appear to be on lockdown. Hmm... Look for me on the monitors. If you see me waving, push the button in front of the corresponding monitor to open the door.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00121a": "(Freddy) Aw.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00190": "(Freddy) Bright lights in the eyes cause us to briefly malfunction. I suppose a Fazerblaster or a Faz Cam could work.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00183": "(Freddy) But here is another Party Pass I found. This should help you in your investigations.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00076": "(Freddy) Can you see me?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00060": "(Freddy) Chica loves pizza!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00172": "(Freddy) Chica, Roxy, Monty. Do not listen. Resist her!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00134": "(Freddy) Come back.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00167": "(Freddy) Come in, Gregory. Can you hear me?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00071": "(Freddy) Consider it a second wind.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00030": "(Freddy) Correct. Fazer Blast, Monty Golf, Roxy Raceway: they are all accessible to S.T.A.F.F. - with high enough clearance of course. Guests are never allowed down here, but yours is a... special situation.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00103": "(Freddy) Correct. It is just... If we separate for any reason- it is not safe for you down here. It is easy to get lost. You should get a utility map from the warehouse. It is on the other side of the stage lift.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00188": "(Freddy) Could you, uh... reattach my head?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00072": "(Freddy) Do not let them in. The security doors are equipped with electrical deterrents. If you see them banging on the doors, hit the appropriate button. The shock should stun them.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00052": "(Freddy) Do not panic. If we get separated again, you can always call me on your Fazwatch - as long as I have power - and I am able to reach you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00058": "(Freddy) Do not panic. Look for the Kitchen Security Office. If you upgrade your security access you should be able to open those doors.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091": "(Freddy) Do not panic. That office is now on lockdown. I can deactivate the alarm, but it will take some time.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00033": "(Freddy) Do not panic. You should see an interface on the security desk. Activate it.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00033b": "(Freddy) Do not panic. You should see an interface on the security desk. Hold on while I will make it accessible to you... there. You can now activate security protocols.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00023": "(Freddy) Do not worry Gregory. Even if we are spotted, you are safe with me. She would never suspect we are traveling together. However, we should still do our best to avoid her. If I am sent back to my room, we will never get to the Lobby before midnight.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00086": "(Freddy) Do you see a set of controls?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00073": "(Freddy) Do you see the large vent in the floor? You are probably standing right on top of it. If I can reach the room under you, I should be able to force it open and let you out.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00003": "(Freddy) Down where?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00117": "(Freddy) Everything seems to be offline. The entire arcade has been shut down. I am afraid the doors to the atrium are locked as well. This is not standard procedure. You should look for the security office on the top floor.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00099": "(Freddy) Fazer Blast, Monty Golf, Roxy Raceway...just to name a few. I have marked all locked attractions on your Faz Map.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00147": "(Freddy) Finally, suggestion number five: Check your Fazwatch cameras for threats and hidden prize boxes. You already have access to the Lobby and Atrium security cameras. Visit other Security Offices to add new camera systems to your Fazwatch.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00080": "(Freddy) Follow me to the atrium. That is a program disk for the stage show. If you use it in the sound booth, you should be able to run a showtime program which will activate the lift.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00169": "(Freddy) Get to the Fazer Blast booth. Use the overhead system.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00169b": "(Freddy) Get to the Fazer Blast booth. Use the security desk.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00064": "(Freddy) Get to the elevator. Find a safe path on your Fazwatch.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00093": "(Freddy) Go to the back of the Prize Counter. The Fire Escape is in the VIP room.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00044": "(Freddy) Go upstairs. And do not worry, they cannot find you while we are together.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00158": "(Freddy) Go upstairs. We need to head back to the Lobby.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00234": "(Freddy) Good job! Take the repaired head back to Roxy Raceway.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00215": "(Freddy) Good job, superstar! You got the Fazerblaster, but you had to use your Party Pass. If you find the security office, I am sure you will find something that will help you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00018": "(Freddy) Good job. Now, please come let me out.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00228": "(Freddy) Good job. You have found a driver assist head. I do not believe it will work in that condition. However, there is a S.T.A.F.F. repair station in the West Arcade. You will need a Dance Pass to access the West Arcade.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00069b": "(Freddy) Good luck, superstar. Entering rest mode.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00061a": "(Freddy) Good news! It looks like the door to El Chip's is open.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00051": "(Freddy) Good news. The front doors will open in five hours.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00082": "(Freddy) Great job superstar. Just push that button and the lift will take us down to Parts and Service.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00176": "(Freddy) Great job, Superstar.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00188a": "(Freddy) Gregory! I am so glad you are here and alive!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00166": "(Freddy) Gregory! Run. Do not look back. Do not watch.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00204": "(Freddy) Gregory! They know you are here. Get the security upgrade and get out!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00199": "(Freddy) Gregory! What are you doing?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00046": "(Freddy) Gregory! Where are you going?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00042": "(Freddy) Gregory, I am unable to reach you. Check the Daycare security desk for a security badge, then let me in.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00157": "(Freddy) Gregory, I do not know what you did, but the lights are out in the Daycare! You need to find the emergency backup generators and turn them on. They are in the play structures.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00054": "(Freddy) Gregory, I have identified two possible exit points. The main loading dock is located under the food court on the first floor. There is also a fire escape in the third floor Prize Counter. Check your Fazwatch. I will mark both locations on your Faz Map.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00130": "(Freddy) Gregory, I know why you are not in the customer database... I remember you from the....",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00043": "(Freddy) Gregory, Jump in! We need to get out of here now. They have found you!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00245": "(Freddy) Gregory, are you certain you have seen a dancing rabbit lady? I believe you if you say you have, but it is highly unlikely. I have not seen her and she does not sound like a character we have at the Pizzaplex.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00238": "(Freddy) Gregory, are you sure? Some would call this a point of no return.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00220": "(Freddy) Gregory, as soon as it is safe, return to Parts and Service. You have the spare parts necessary to begin an upgrade procedure.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00241": "(Freddy) Gregory, be careful. This elevator does not appear to follow any safety protocols. I do not think it can survive more than one trip.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00218": "(Freddy) Gregory, did you read that message? It said there is a bag of Monty Mystery Mix behind the Bowling alley. Chica goes coo coo for Monty Mystery Mix.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00235": "(Freddy) Gregory, good news! It is almost 6 o'clock. You will be safe now if you find an exit. But hurry! The Daycare Attendant is loose one last time.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00081": "(Freddy) Gregory, my systems are failing. Go to the sound booth on the third floor balcony. Run the performance program on that disk then meet me back on the stage. Please hurry. You do not have much time. It is almost the end of the hour. I will wait here.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00244": "(Freddy) Gregory, please. We should stick together.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00078": "(Freddy) Gregory, push the button!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00195": "(Freddy) Gregory, that Party Pass is very special. It will let you into Fazer Blast or Monty Golf. However, it can only be used once.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00100": "(Freddy) Gregory, those parts belong to my friends. I would never do anything to hurt them.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00178": "(Freddy) Gregory, you have a choice to make. The door is open and you can go. Or you can continue to investigate the secrets of the Pizzaplex. I feel there is something else going on besides Vanny.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00178b": "(Freddy) Gregory, you have a choice to make. The door is open and you can go. Or you can continue to investigate the secrets of the Pizzaplex. I feel there is something else going on besides the dancing rabbit lady.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00121": "(Freddy) Gregory. Check out these shirts. Which one do you like best?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00159": "(Freddy) Gregory. I am too big to go through vents.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00205": "(Freddy) Gregory. I do not mean to be intrusive, but I read that message that you found in the security office. There may be a chance to stop Monty from hunting you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00242": "(Freddy) Gregory. I have a bad feeling. I do not wish to go down there. If we do, do not expect to return. This is your decision. Are you ready?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00008": "(Freddy) Gregory. I will notify the main office. Huh, connection error. I cannot connect to the main network.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00233": "(Freddy) Gregory. The security system knows you are here and has locked you out. Reset the breakers and restore power to the West Arcade, then you can repair the S.T.A.F.F. bot head.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00106": "(Freddy) Gregory. This upgrade... It was Chica's. Please, be honest. How did you get it?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00137": "(Freddy) Gregory...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00065": "(Freddy) Gregory... Gregory...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00070": "(Freddy) Gregory? What did you do? Something happened. I can communicate again. I think you fixed my signal. Thank you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00151": "(Freddy) Gulp!!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00229": "(Freddy) Have you checked the party garages? The raceway was closed very abruptly prior to the new construction. Guests tend to leave things behind during emergency situations.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00161": "(Freddy) He is trying to take control of me. I do not think I can fight it for long.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00231": "(Freddy) Head to the security office. You'll find the S.T.A.F.F. bot repair machine there.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00014": "(Freddy) Hello, Gregory. It is me, Freddy. I will escort you to the main entrance. However, I am unable to leave this room. There is a button that will open the maintenance closet, but I have been programmed not to notice it. It should be around here somewhere.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00014b": "(Freddy) Hello, Gregory. It is me, Freddy. I will escort you to the main entrance. However, I am unable to leave this room. You should have no problem. There is a button on the wall that will open the door to the back room. I will make it accessible to you now.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00246": "(Freddy) Hello? Is someone there? I am afraid I can not see you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00068": "(Freddy) Help me get to Parts and Service.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00236": "(Freddy) Hey superstars! It's me, Freddy! Welcome to the Mega Pizzaplex! Grab a jumbo slice of pepperoni and top it off with an ice cold Fizzy Faz. Then enjoy our super games and attractions. Don't forget to stop by Rockstar Row and meet me in person! Have fun and have a Faz-eriffic day!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00165": "(Freddy) Hide!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00105": "(Freddy) How fortunate. I should now be able to smash through the cyclone fences around the building the way Monty does.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00036": "(Freddy) How unfortunate, Gregory. You missed your chance, but there is still hope. You should be able to escape when the security doors reopen at 6:00am. Until then, keep moving and try not to draw attention to yourself. If there is another way out, I will help you find it. I promise.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00059": "(Freddy) How unfortunate. But I have good news: It looks like you can access the Fazbear online pizza delivery system through that console!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00089": "(Freddy) How unfortunate. Head past the Superstar-cade wall, to the back of the arcade. There is a roll up door at the very back which leads to the Prize Counter.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00185": "(Freddy) How unfortunate. If you reattach my head, I will go look for him now.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00181": "(Freddy) How unfortunate. The Save Spots have been hacked. They are no longer usable.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00074": "(Freddy) Hurry Gregory! I cannot stop her.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00122a": "(Freddy) I AM NOT ME.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00024": "(Freddy) I am detecting blood. You are injured.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00109": "(Freddy) I am having a hard time adjusting. You look different to me. I can see movement through the walls.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00049": "(Freddy) I am not.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00013": "(Freddy) I am sending you an encoded message.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00226": "(Freddy) I am so sorry. It appears you are not tall enough to ride the karts alone. You will need a working driver assist bot in order to use this kart.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00022": "(Freddy) I am sorry Gregory. I would love to do a tour, but it is closing time and this door is locked. Look for a door with my icon on it.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00140": "(Freddy) I am sorry Gregory. You did not make it out in time. That is unfortunate. The main entrance will not open again until 6 am. Think of it as a slumber party. Or a \"Lock-In\". That is a party where you lock all the children in a building then have a slumber party. No one is allowed to enter or leave. It is fun. Fazbear Entertainment no longer hosts Lock-Ins... for legal reasons.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00094": "(Freddy) I am sorry, Gregory. I am in no condition to carry you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00038": "(Freddy) I am sorry, Gregory. I am truly sorry.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00031": "(Freddy) I am terribly sorry. The recharge cycle had not yet completed when I found you. You must continue without me. I will guide you on your Fazwatch in case you get into any trouble.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00224": "(Freddy) I am very glad you made it to the recharge station, Gregory.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00202": "(Freddy) I am your friend.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00027": "(Freddy) I apologize.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00126": "(Freddy) I cannot believe you were able to collect enough toys to become a VIP.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00200": "(Freddy) I cannot see!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00221": "(Freddy) I could open this gate if I had Monty's claws.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00118": "(Freddy) I do not come up here anymore. I miss him.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00050": "(Freddy) I do not know. I want to help you. Maybe they want to help you too.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00098": "(Freddy) I do not know. I was holding it when I rebooted. You can use it to open the gates to one of the many attractions. But it can only be used once. You will have to find additional Party Passes to access the other attractions.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00024a": "(Freddy) I feel you are broken.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00115": "(Freddy) I have never been allowed in here before. This must be where I was born. Look at all the endos. They are all the same... Have I always been a Freddy? Am I Monty with a different shell? What if I am not the first Glamrock Freddy? Are there more of me at other pizzerias? Do we all feel the same? Am I special? If I am mass produced, am I still art?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00096": "(Freddy) I have something for you. Take it.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00132": "(Freddy) I hear what some guests say about me. Bad things happened in the past. But that was not me. Those were older models - Flawed. I would never hurt anyone. You know that, right?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00020": "(Freddy) I know how to get you out of here. Climb back into my chest cavity.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00122": "(Freddy) I know what this is. I have been here before. She brought me here. I found myself for the first time when I cleared the path. I did not want to, but I had no choice. Now, I have a choice. I have changed. My friends are here. They are so angry... confused... but I can protect you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00230": "(Freddy) I must stay here. I wish I could join you, but after tonight's stage incident, I am not allowed to perform. When I step onto the West Arcade dance floor, I cannot stop myself. It is a programming bug.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00062": "(Freddy) I must warn you: when you enter an area where you do not have a locator map signal, I will be unable to reach your location. You can update your mini-map at a security office. Be safe.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00028": "(Freddy) I said nothing. I will keep you safe. Let us go.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00004": "(Freddy) I still do not see you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00168": "(Freddy) I still have a signal.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00135": "(Freddy) I thought we were friends.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00037": "(Freddy) I wonder what the free prize is?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00227": "(Freddy) I would love to drive with you, but I am too big.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00193b": "(Freddy) I'm going. I'm going.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091b": "(Freddy) If you feel you are in danger, close the doors but you can not keep them closed forever. There is limited power available during a lockdown. If you run out of power, the doors will no longer close. I suggest you only close the doors when absolutely necessary.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00066": "(Freddy) If you get this message, come to the Roxy Raceway entrance on the second floor. I piled up some boxes so you can hop over the construction fence and find me. Something is jamming my communications signal. Come to the Roxy Raceway...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00214": "(Freddy) If you have not done so already, you should check the Fazer Blast Office.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00232": "(Freddy) If you see the DJ, say \"Hello.\" He is such a nice fellow.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091a": "(Freddy) In the meantime, stay where you are. That noise is bound to draw attention. If you leave the office, you will be easier to find.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00107": "(Freddy) Is she ok?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00111": "(Freddy) Is she ok?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00055": "(Freddy) It appears that you have no Faz Map. You should be able to obtain one from the greeter on the center balcony.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00097": "(Freddy) It is a Freddy Fazbear PARTY PASS.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00223": "(Freddy) It is almost the end of the hour! Get to a recharge station, Gregory, before the Daycare Attendant comes!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00069": "(Freddy) It is down under the main stage. Normally, the stage lift takes me down there after every concert. That is really the only way I know how.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00056": "(Freddy) It looks like you do not have security clearance to access the kitchen. Find the open vent near the salad bar to bypass security.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00079": "(Freddy) Jump down!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00196": "(Freddy) Just give it to a party bot. They usually stay in front of the attractions collecting Party Passes. If you have one, it will let you in. I have marked both locations on your map.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00189": "(Freddy) Just reconnect the wires and be careful. I am not quite myself at the moment.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00240": "(Freddy) Lead the way, superstar.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00112": "(Freddy) Look for a security Office. There should be a map and a security badge.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00197": "(Freddy) Look for the Security Office in the back hallway. Since there is no flash photography allowed in Monty Golf, Faz Cams are often confiscated here. Mainly because they are only sold in Monty Golf. It is a very clever marketing plan.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00162": "(Freddy) Look out. It's Chica.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00243": "(Freddy) Look, that Save Spot is working. If anything happens we will return to this spot.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00206": "(Freddy) Monty loves hanging out on the catwalks. You can find the entrance in Mazercise.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00219": "(Freddy) Monty's mystery mix. The mystery is the pizza flavoring.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00104": "(Freddy) My arms are different. Where did you get these parts?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00128": "(Freddy) My finger doubles as a lighter. You know, for birthday candles. And Crème Brûlée.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00005": "(Freddy) My stomach hatch? That place is reserved for oversized birthday cakes and piñatas! It is not a safe play area!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00152": "(Freddy) Need a hand?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00048": "(Freddy) No, I did not. There is no rabbit at the Mega Pizzaplex... Not anymore.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00025a": "(Freddy) No, I feel that something is wrong. I am taking you to the first aid station.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00123": "(Freddy) No. I can not exit outside of this facility.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00174": "(Freddy) No. Stop. No. Please.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00225": "(Freddy) Now that I have been upgraded, I should be able to access the Roxy Raceway. I have not been there for a very long time, but perhaps you can find some clues on how to deal with Roxy while you are there.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00026": "(Freddy) Officer Vanessa, I do not know how I got here.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00017": "(Freddy) Oh? You are going to need a Photo Pass to open the door. Apologies, I assumed you had one already... Well, you should be able to find one at a convenience counter.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00128a": "(Freddy) Oops",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00142": "(Freddy) Otherwise, I have compiled a list of 5 suggestions to help you through the night.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00075": "(Freddy) Over here!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00119": "(Freddy) Perhaps if you adjusted the heat in the boiler room, you could melt it. The boiler room is down in the utilidors. I will mark it on your map. However, I do not recommend you go there.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00039": "(Freddy) Perhaps there is a way to hack it back out. Try Glamrock Gifts. They have lots of trinkets, knickknacks, and doodads.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00173": "(Freddy) Please. you do not want to do this.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00194": "(Freddy) Quick, find a recharge station. You should be able to see their locations on the map.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00077": "(Freddy) Quickly! Open the door.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00083": "(Freddy) Quickly. Get to the recharge station! Follow me.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00085": "(Freddy) Routine maintenance. I am functioning much more better... now. Hm. Grammar function error... Perhaps I am still not at peak performance.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00007": "(Freddy) Scanning complete. How odd. Your guest profile is unknown to me. Who are you?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00212": "(Freddy) Shame on you, Gregory. We cannot enter together. That would be cheating. I am programmed not to cheat.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00001": "(Freddy) Showtime already?! I am experiencing a malfunction. The recharge cycle is not complete.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00163": "(Freddy) Shut the doors!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00209": "(Freddy) So. There is a vent in this maze that leads to the Monty Golf catwalks. I believe there is a control panel for the maze around here somewhere.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00087b": "(Freddy) Something is not right. Someone must have changed the permissions. You are going to need a much higher security level to get out that way. Come back to me right away.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00160": "(Freddy) Stop him...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00146": "(Freddy) Suggestion number four; You need to hide in a recharge station at the end of every hour. I will meet you there. You can also call me from your Fazwatch at any time to help... as long as I can find you and have power remaining.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00143": "(Freddy) Suggestion number one; Look for prize boxes that have been hidden throughout the building. They should have helpful items to get you through the night.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00145": "(Freddy) Suggestion number three; You must stay hidden and keep moving until the Lobby doors open at 6:00am.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00144": "(Freddy) Suggestion number two; If you find a party pass, give it to the \"Party Staff\" to access the attractions after hours.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00136": "(Freddy) Superstar...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00012": "(Freddy) Take this. It is a novelty Freddy Fazwatch.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00148": "(Freddy) Thank you for taking the time to listen, Gregory. I wish you luck. The security doors will open in 3... 2... 1...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00198": "(Freddy) That is a Faz Cam. If you are in trouble, use the camera flash to stun the other animatronics. Keep in mind that it will not work on Monty, due to his sunglasses.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00047": "(Freddy) That is a fountain. A fountain is a decorative reservoir used for discharging water.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00108": "(Freddy) That is a relief. With this new voice box, I should be able to make a vocal pitch that will stun animatronics.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00041": "(Freddy) That is great news! I will meet you in the daycare. The entrance is on the second floor balcony.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00184": "(Freddy) That is great news. He can be returned to his parents.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00114": "(Freddy) That is not possible. You must be mistaken. An Endo cannot function without its shell.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00010": "(Freddy) That is the security guard. She can help!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00237": "(Freddy) That was not me. That was a recording. I want to make sure you are not confused.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00156": "(Freddy) The Atrium is locked. You will need to upgrade your ticket to get inside. Find the upgrade machine in Customer Service.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00143a": "(Freddy) The Freddy Fazbear mega Pizzaplex deluxe lock-in birthday scavenger hunt package is normally reserved for special birthday kids. We will make an exception in your case... seeing as how you are not the birthday boy.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091c": "(Freddy) The cameras on your Fazwatch should help.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00164": "(Freddy) The doors will not hold her.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00203": "(Freddy) The security office is nearby. You might want to look around the office and see if there is a way to stop Monty from hunting you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00179": "(Freddy) There is also something strange happening in Fazer Blast. I do not know what it is, but I can take you there if you wish to investigate.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00016": "(Freddy) There is nothing to be scared of. You can do it.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00021": "(Freddy) There is still time, but we must hurry. If I am spotted, I will certainly be taken back to my room. I will escort you to the main exit through the utility tunnels. It is the safest path.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00101": "(Freddy) There must be a good explanation. They are not capable of hurting a guest. None of us are! It would go against our programming.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00120": "(Freddy) There must be a problem with the main generator. Until power has been restored, I am afraid it will remain dark. Many doors will not function properly. Your Fazwatch should still work, though. I have marked the location of the generator on your map.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00067": "(Freddy) There you are! I was so worried. I waited and waited for you. I missed the hourly recharge and have been trying to get down to Parts and Service. I think something is wrong.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00006": "(Freddy) There you are.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00110": "(Freddy) These are Roxy's eyes?!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00235b": "(Freddy) These eyes are amazing! There are wondrous colors and objects I never knew existed. Nothing can hide from me now!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00037a": "(Freddy) These turnstiles require a Complimentary Pizzaplex Entry Pass. There should be one located near the main entrance.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00090": "(Freddy) They are... required safety measures due to past issues. Look for another way in.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00095": "(Freddy) This is the Parts and Service center. When any of the band members have technical problems, we are sent here for maintenance. We also receive software upgrades... when our behaviors need correction.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00222": "(Freddy) This requires Chica's voice to activate.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00113": "(Freddy) Those are Endoskeletons.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00087": "(Freddy) Those are the loading dock controls.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00035": "(Freddy) Those boxes on your mini-map are nearby security cameras. When movement is detected by the camera's motion sensors, you should see red alert icons. Switch between the cameras to find a safe path out of the office and to the main lobby.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00040": "(Freddy) Try that magnet you found.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00040a": "(Freddy) Try that terrible magnet you found.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00170": "(Freddy) Turn them against VANNY.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00069a": "(Freddy) Use that door behind me. It will take you to the rehearsal room on the other side of the building. Look for a Backstage Pass then find a way to turn on the lift.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00084": "(Freddy) Use the console to let me out.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00192": "(Freddy) Use the service elevators at the back of the room. They go up to Rockstar Row. It looks like they are all out of order except for Roxy's.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00186": "(Freddy) Vanessa, all the Fazwatches sound like me. It is the default voice option.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00187": "(Freddy) Vanessa, do not leave me like this!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00150": "(Freddy) WHOAAAH!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00149": "(Freddy) Wanna join our band?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00165b": "(Freddy) Watch the vents!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00019": "(Freddy) Way to go, superstar! I knew you could do it.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00045": "(Freddy) We are almost out of time. We need to get to a recharge station immediately. Every hour the power is diverted to the recharge stations. When that happens the lights go out, and when <i>that</> happens the Daycare attendant is free to roam the building. It <i>will</> find you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00029": "(Freddy) We are now under the Pizzaplex. These utility tunnels connect all the attractions.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00053": "(Freddy) We should get moving. You can access the main atrium with your new security badge.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00015": "(Freddy) Well done, Gregory. There is an open air vent inside the maintenance room. You will have to climb through the ventilation system and release me from the outside.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00088": "(Freddy) Well done, Gregory. You are in the East Arcade. You should be able to get to the Prize Counter through the security office. Look for the door with a security badge symbol on it.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00032": "(Freddy) Well done, Gregory. You found a security office. You should be quite safe here. The doors were designed to keep our highly-trained security staff safe in the event of an emergency. As long as the doors stay closed, which they will, as long as there is ample power...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00213": "(Freddy) Well done, superstar! You won the Fazerblaster. Now, go collect your prize from the Superstar Lounge.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00154": "(Freddy) Well done, superstar. You have accessed the Lobby. Unfortunately, that complimentary entry ticket does not allow you to enter the pizzeria.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00193": "(Freddy) Well done.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00057": "(Freddy) Well done. You are near the Fizzy Faz syrup vats. You should be able to find your way to the Main Kitchen from here.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00217": "(Freddy) What amazing luck. You got an annual Bonnie Bowl unlimited pass. Free bowling for a whole year! Mega Pizzaplex entry not included. Shoe and ball rental fees still apply.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00131": "(Freddy) Whatever it is, do not let it find you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00102": "(Freddy) Where are you going?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00133": "(Freddy) Where are you going?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00138": "(Freddy) Where are you?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00002": "(Freddy) Who said that?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00009": "(Freddy) Who? Who is looking for you? Your mother?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00139": "(Freddy) Why do you hide?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00011": "(Freddy) Why not?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00201": "(Freddy) Why, though?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00124": "(Freddy) Without a recharge station, my systems would shut down within an hour. It is a safety precaution. It is my design. This is where I must stay. Do not return. It will never be safe. I will miss you.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00182": "(Freddy) Yes! Come. Let us end this!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00125": "(Freddy) Yes. I am afraid that is correct.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00171": "(Freddy) You are my Superstar...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00239": "(Freddy) You are staying? I am glad. Here. I found this Party Pass. There are areas we have not investigated.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00155": "(Freddy) You can find an upgrade machine in Customer Service.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00247": "(Freddy) You can no longer hide from me. I have new eyes.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00180": "(Freddy) You can still return here and leave later, if you have second thoughts.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00191": "(Freddy) You can win a Fazerblaster in Fazer Blast. Faz Cams are often confiscated in Monty Golf, but you will need a Party Pass to open one of those attractions. Chica normally gives them out for birthdays. Check her greenroom in Rockstar Row. You may find one there.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00129": "(Freddy) You found a Security Badge. For every badge you carry, your security access increases. It is an odd system which would be easy to exploit. It seems like an untrustworthy person could take advantage of such an obvious security weakness, but I highly doubt anyone would be that dishonest?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00063": "(Freddy) You found the Fire Escape. Unfortunately, I do not think there is a way to reach it without becoming a VIP. It is not a very good emergency system. You are lucky there is not a fire. I have lodged a formal complaint.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00208": "(Freddy) You found the Mazercise ticket! Now you can enter Mazercise.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00207": "(Freddy) You need to find a Mazercise ticket to get into Mazercise. Check the area.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00141": "(Freddy) You seem impatient. Do not worry about the security door. It will remain closed as long as there is power left in this zone's emergency generator. However, if you wish to leave this office, press the flashing button on the security console. It will open the security doors so you may leave...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00127": "(Freddy) You sure collected a lot of toys. Perhaps we can do something to stop whatever is going on here...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00034": "(Freddy) Your Fazwatch is now connected to the security camera system. Check the map on your Fazwatch.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00025": "(Freddy) Your arm is cut badly. I will take you to a first aid station.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00096a": "(Gregory) ...that one. I guess.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00011": "(Gregory) Ah! My arm.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00154": "(Gregory) Alright Roxy, here I come.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00119": "(Gregory) Attention. Command voice override.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00105": "(Gregory) C'mon. Where are you?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00121": "(Gregory) Dismantle Vanny. Dismantle Vanny.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00015": "(Gregory) Don't worry about it. I'm fine.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00015a": "(Gregory) Don't worry about it. I'm fine.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00080": "(Gregory) Exactly like he did.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00050": "(Gregory) Freddy said I can find a Backstage Pass around here somewhere...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00159": "(Gregory) Freddy said I should go downstairs to the kitchen, or upstairs through El Chip's to the fire escape.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00159b": "(Gregory) Freddy said I should go downstairs to the kitchen, or upstairs to the Prize Counter.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00061": "(Gregory) Freddy said the booth is on the third floor.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00067": "(Gregory) Freddy!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00046": "(Gregory) Freddy! Are you ok?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00140": "(Gregory) Freddy! I found the party pass!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00098": "(Gregory) Freddy! It's open! Let's go!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00058": "(Gregory) Freddy! You saved me!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00127": "(Gregory) Freddy's in there. I have to get him out.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00036": "(Gregory) Freddy, Are you there? I'm trapped! Chica found me and there's only one security door!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00035": "(Gregory) Freddy, I can't open any of these doors. I think I am stuck in here.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00025": "(Gregory) Freddy, I found the free gift!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00056": "(Gregory) Freddy, I see Roxy and Monty on the cameras. They're both coming to the office!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00127a": "(Gregory) Freddy, can you hear me?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00076": "(Gregory) Freddy, check out these pictures. Chica has some sort of special voice box, Roxy has new eyes, and Monty was given better claws. We have to get these! We could upgrade you!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00040a": "(Gregory) Freddy, everything's locked! I can't get out of here!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00044": "(Gregory) Freddy, help! That rabbit lady found me!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00100": "(Gregory) Freddy, if I leave now, nothing will change, will it? There will be more disappearances.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00070": "(Gregory) Freddy, it's not opening.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00118": "(Gregory) Freddy, no!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00117": "(Gregory) Freddy, that rabbit lady's in a secret room above Fazer Blast. It looks like a hideout. I think her name is \"Vanny\".",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00040": "(Gregory) Freddy, the doors are all locked! I can't get out of here!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00021": "(Gregory) Freddy, the power is only at 15% and they're pounding on the door! How am I going to get out of here?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00132": "(Gregory) Freddy, there's something here.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00103": "(Gregory) Freddy. I don't think I'm alone in here...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00104": "(Gregory) Freddy. I need your help.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00143": "(Gregory) Freddy. It's cold in here.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00094": "(Gregory) Freddy. It's freezing in here...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00074": "(Gregory) Freddy? Freddy, are you there?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00102": "(Gregory) Freddy? Freddy? Are you ok?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00034": "(Gregory) Good news? Five hours? I'm not gonna last five minutes!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00136": "(Gregory) Got it! I can open Parts and Service now.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00051": "(Gregory) Got it! Now I should be able to find the lift controls.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00142": "(Gregory) Great. How do I use it?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00124": "(Gregory) He? What is that thing?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00091": "(Gregory) Hey! Over here!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00128": "(Gregory) Hmm. It's a map of the utility tunnels. There's a security office nearby. If I can find another Security Badge, I can get into Parts and Service.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00092": "(Gregory) Hot! Too hot!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00083": "(Gregory) How are your new eyes?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00093": "(Gregory) Huh. I guess these buttons do something to the maze...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00158": "(Gregory) Huh. I wonder what's up there?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00060": "(Gregory) I better avoid that spotlight.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00045": "(Gregory) I can hear you! I'm on my way!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00054": "(Gregory) I can see you on the monitor.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00002": "(Gregory) I did! I'm down here!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00055": "(Gregory) I didn't think you could stand up.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00020": "(Gregory) I don't know if I can do this alone!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00008": "(Gregory) I don't know who she is, but <i>she's trying to get me</>. Isn't there some other way for you to communicate with me besides talking so loudly?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00008_alt": "(Gregory) I don't know who she is, but she's gonna kill me. Isn't there some other way for you to communicate with me besides talking so loudly?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00096": "(Gregory) I don't know... uh...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00033": "(Gregory) I doubt it. For some reason, you're different.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00137": "(Gregory) I dunno. It looks complicated.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00039": "(Gregory) I found the loading dock, but there's nothing here.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00075": "(Gregory) I might be able to get out through this vent but I don't have anything to open it. Maybe there is something in all this junk that could help.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00149": "(Gregory) I need something to lure Chica into the trash compactor.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00161": "(Gregory) I need to complete one of those attractions to get another one.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00160": "(Gregory) I need to find another party pass.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00069": "(Gregory) I think so. There's a funny locked box with a badge on it.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00089": "(Gregory) I think that Endo moved.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00017": "(Gregory) I told you she was after me.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00079": "(Gregory) I'd rather not say.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00028": "(Gregory) I'm not going out there without a flashlight. It's too dark!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00059": "(Gregory) I'm so sorry. I couldn't find any lift controls. All I found was this... disk thing.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00043": "(Gregory) I'm trapped.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00004": "(Gregory) I- I'm Gregory.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00047": "(Gregory) Is there anything I can do?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00026": "(Gregory) It ate my pass!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00126": "(Gregory) It's Chica. Maybe I could distract her with something.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00125": "(Gregory) It's Roxy. What do I do?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00153": "(Gregory) It's a broken robot head.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00025a": "(Gregory) It's a crappy Mr. Hippo fridge magnet? Lame.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00130": "(Gregory) It's blocked. I wonder if there's a way around.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00005": "(Gregory) It's her. She cut you off. She's not going to let you call for help until she finds me.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00147": "(Gregory) It's open! Come on! Freddy?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00010": "(Gregory) It's pretty dark in there.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00135": "(Gregory) It's the Security office. Hm. Should be one of those badge head things in here.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00066": "(Gregory) Leave him alone!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00071": "(Gregory) Locked again? Why does a pizza place need so much security?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00108": "(Gregory) Maybe there's something in Glamrock Gifts... on the first floor... next to the checkout counter... to the left...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00107": "(Gregory) My ticket's still stuck. How am I supposed to upgrade my ticket if I can't hack this stupid thing? I should look around some more.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00007": "(Gregory) No! No, I don't trust her.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00073": "(Gregory) No, no, no! Freddy! I don't know what happened! All I did was take the badge.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00022": "(Gregory) No. No! Wait! I'm still here!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00131": "(Gregory) Not again...",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00030": "(Gregory) Not the fountain! You didn't see the dancing rabbit lady right in front of us?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00086": "(Gregory) Nothing seems to stop her.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00023": "(Gregory) Now what am I supposed to do?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00057": "(Gregory) OK, but how do I get out of here?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00048": "(Gregory) Of course I will! How do we get there?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00099": "(Gregory) Of course you can! Come on! We can hide you somewhere.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00151": "(Gregory) Oh man, the robot's missing it's head!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00064": "(Gregory) Oh no! What time is it? That moon thing's going to get me!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00136b": "(Gregory) Oh, come on!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00141": "(Gregory) Oh, crap! It's that horrible moon thing again!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00133": "(Gregory) Oh, crap.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00013": "(Gregory) Ok. But you better be careful moving around. I don't want to be crushed and twisted into a meat pretzel.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00049": "(Gregory) Ok. I'll do my best.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00003": "(Gregory) Okay listen, you were sleeping so I opened the stomach hatch and climbed inside.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00152": "(Gregory) Okay, I got the head, but it's broken! How do I fix it?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00122": "(Gregory) Princess Quest 3?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00148": "(Gregory) Punch it, Freddy!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00114": "(Gregory) Really? I can go on any attraction?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00084": "(Gregory) Really? I didn't know Roxy could see through walls.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00014": "(Gregory) She's down here! We have to go back.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00006": "(Gregory) Shh! I hear footsteps.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00001": "(Gregory) Shh! Will you shut up?!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00097": "(Gregory) So, this sinkhole is why the raceway is closed? I wonder what's down there.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00112": "(Gregory) So, what is this place?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00088": "(Gregory) So. This is what you look like inside? Creepy. I like you better with your shell on.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00157": "(Gregory) Someone has to have the right combination written down somewhere.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00078": "(Gregory) Somewhere else. I can't stay here, right?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00090": "(Gregory) That crate says \"Driver Assist\". Hey, the lid's open.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00095": "(Gregory) That endo's frozen solid. It's holding some sort of camera.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00063": "(Gregory) That should do it. I hope Freddy's ok. I should get back to the stage right away.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00134": "(Gregory) That wall just moved!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00129": "(Gregory) The lift reset. I don't see a way to control it from here.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00012": "(Gregory) The stupid door won't open.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00068": "(Gregory) There are some big garage doors, but I don't see a way to get out.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00065": "(Gregory) There! On the wall.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00150": "(Gregory) There's no power in the trash compactor! I need to find a generator.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00016": "(Gregory) There's no time! I'm fine!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00138": "(Gregory) There's so much tech stuff in here. Is there anything I can use to stop the other bots?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00053": "(Gregory) There's something else in here. What's this? It looks... old.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00156": "(Gregory) These buttons change the maze. I wonder what the right combination is?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00110": "(Gregory) This door needs a Daycare pass.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00052": "(Gregory) This is backstage? I guess it's why they keep the curtains closed.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00031": "(Gregory) This is crazy. It's like the whole place is trying to get me!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00024": "(Gregory) This ticket doesn't even work. It says, \"Good for entrance to the lobby shops. Upgrade options available at Customer Service. Also good for one free prize from Glamrock Gifts, while supplies last.\"",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00128b": "(Gregory) Ugh! I hate that thing!",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00115": "(Gregory) Uh. I don't know. I'm just a kid. Maybe we should get you out of here. I don't think it's good for your programming.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00120": "(Gregory) Uh... are you having fun yet?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00019": "(Gregory) We can go anywhere in the building?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00146": "(Gregory) We did find that sinkhole under the raceway. There has to be a way to get down there.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00087": "(Gregory) Well, it's a really big room with robot stuff. It's pretty quiet in here. There are these robot skeleton things hanging on hooks. Am I in the right place?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00101": "(Gregory) Well, we saw her hideout, right? In Fazer Blast. Maybe we could catch her there. If she thinks I escaped, maybe we can surprise her.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00085": "(Gregory) Well, yeah. There was an accident in the raceway.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00082": "(Gregory) Well... she's still functional.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00009": "(Gregory) What was that?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00029": "(Gregory) What was that?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00106": "(Gregory) What was that? Are you ok?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00038": "(Gregory) What won't she eat? I saw her eating out of a trash can earlier. I didn't think robots needed to eat.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00111": "(Gregory) What'd they do to you?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00144": "(Gregory) What's this? Looks like an old camera.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00062a": "(Gregory) What's with all the security barriers?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00077": "(Gregory) What? All they've done all night is try to hurt me! They get what they deserve.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00037": "(Gregory) What? How is that supposed to help?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00081": "(Gregory) When I was in the kitchen earlier, she fell into some sort of garbage smasher.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00042": "(Gregory) Where am I? Look at all this stuff.",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00018": "(Gregory) Where are we?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00139": "(Gregory) Where do I get one?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00109": "(Gregory) Where does this vent go?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00113": "(Gregory) Where'd it come from?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00116": "(Gregory) Why are the lights still out?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00062": "(Gregory) Why are there so many more security barriers now?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00032": "(Gregory) Why?",
    "Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00072": "(Gregory) Yes! Found it.",
